   setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\src\flutter\bin"
   ```

#### Option B: Using Chocolatey

choco install flutter
```

### 2. Verify Installation
Open a new Command Prompt/PowerShell and run:
```cmd
flutter doctor
```

2. Install with default settings
3. During setup, ensure these components are installed:
   - Android SDK
   - Android SDK Platform-Tools
   - Android SDK Build-Tools
   - Android Emulator

```

### 5. Project Setup Commands

Navigate to your project directory and run these commands:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\athar\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\board_game_moongi

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

```

### 7. Troubleshooting

#### If Flutter is not recognized:
1. Close and reopen your terminal
2. Check PATH: `echo %PATH%`
3. Verify Flutter: `flutter --version`
