## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Architecture
The application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```
lib/
├── src/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── game/              # Base game classes
│   │   ├── routing/           # Navigation with GoRouter
│   │   ├── services/          # Database and utility services
│   │   └── theme/             # App theming and styling
│   ├── features/
│   │   ├── main_menu/         # Main menu and navigation
│   │   ├── profile/           # Player management
│   │   ├── tic_tac_toe/       # Tic-Tac-Toe game
│   │   ├── snakes_ladders/    # Snakes & Ladders game
│   │   └── ludo/              # Ludo game
│   └── shared/                # Shared utilities and widgets
```

### Design Patterns Used
- **State Management**: Provider pattern with ChangeNotifier
- **Game Architecture**: Strategy pattern for AI implementations
- **Data Persistence**: Repository pattern with Isar database
- **Navigation**: Declarative routing with GoRouter

## 🎯 AI Implementation

### Tic-Tac-Toe AI
- **Algorithm**: Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
- **Difficulty**: Unbeatable at max depth (9)
- **Features**: Perfect play, optimal moves

### Snakes & Ladders AI
- **Algorithm**: Simple dice-based AI
- **Features**: Random dice rolls, automatic piece movement
- **Focus**: Smooth animations and user experience

### Ludo AI
- **Algorithm**: Heuristic-based decision making
- **Scoring System**:
  - +100 points for pieces reaching home
  - +50 points for getting pieces out of home
  - +30 points for capturing opponent pieces
  - +2 points per position moved
  - -20 points for unsafe positions
- **Strategy**: Prioritizes getting pieces out, capturing, and reaching home

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Framework**: Flutter 3.10+
- **Language**: Dart 3.0+
- **State Management**: Provider + ChangeNotifier
- **Local Database**: Isar (fast, local object persistence)
- **Navigation**: GoRouter
- **Animations**: Flutter's built-in Animation framework + flutter_animate
